The 2014 ICC World Twenty20 was the fifth ICC World Twenty20 competition, an international Twenty20 cricket tournament, that took place in Bangladesh from 16 March to 6 April 2014, which was won by Sri Lanka. It was played in three cities â€” Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet. The International Cricket Council announced Bangladesh as host in 2010. It was the second consecutive time that an Asian country is hosting this event, as Sri Lanka hosted the previous tournament in 2012. Sri Lanka won the tournament, defeating India by 6 wickets in the final at Mirpur.

<a href="/news">Pulse of TECN</a> is an internal-facing forum featuring news written for and by the TECN community. This online hub gives you a unique opportunity to reach a broad internal audience on tecn.ac

Pulse relies on communicators across campus to help create a robust, engaging news report for faculty and staff. Stories published to Pulse not only have the opportunity to be seen by the site’s thousands of visitors.
<h3>What kinds of stories are right for Pulse?</h3>
Pulse features campus news that falls into four main categories:

<strong>Spotlight</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Human interest stories highlighting a person, team or group in the TECN community</li>
 	<li>Obituaries for current or former TECN leaders, or other high-profile community members.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Announcements</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Stories about new initiatives or programs, major appointments, interesting opportunities or policy changes at TECN. Announcements should be of interest to a broad segment of the community.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Happenings</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Coverage of high-profile, unique or milestone events on campus.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Honors &amp; Awards</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Stories about major grants or award funding. Because we’re unable to include every significant funding announcement, our criteria is generally at least $1 million and/or national attention.</li>
 	<li>Stories about national- or international-level awards.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Events &amp; Schedules<em>
</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Sports, cultuaral, social and other events schedule notices</li>
 	<li>Campus, national and international events reporting</li>
</ul>
<h3>What kinds of stories are <u>not</u> right for Pulse?</h3>
There are many extraordinary and interesting things happening at TECN every day. Unfortunately we cannot include every story. Some types of stories that generally don’t work well on Pulse include:
<ul>
 	<li>Regional, local, or departmental awards</li>
 	<li>School- or department-specific news that may not be of interest to other schools or departments</li>
 	<li>Non-TECN sponsored events or fundraisers</li>
 	<li>Opinion pieces</li>
</ul>
<h3>How do I submit a story to Pulse?</h3>
There are two ways to submit a story:

1)  Fill out a <a href="/pulse/submit">Submit a Campus News Story form</a>.

2)  Email your story idea to <a href="http://info@tecn.ac.bd">info@tecn.ac.bd</a>

Here are some quick tips for your submission:

<strong>Keep it simple. </strong>The Pulse audience is broad – everyone from non-academic staff to busy bussinessmen– so write something that is interesting and understandable to as many people as possible.

<strong>Concise is key.</strong> More and more users are accessing Pulse on their mobile phones, so shorter stories do better.  Please aim to write no more than 300-400 words.

<strong>Catch their eye.</strong> Data shows visual stories tend to get better traffic. Try to submit at least one high-quality photograph (minimum 1 MB) to boost your story’s reach. Please include a caption identifying the people in the image and the significance of what they’re doing.

Fabric Testing: Fabric dimensions, measurement of length, width, thickness, ends and picks per unit length in woven fabric, courses and wales per unit length in kitted fabric. Crimp of yarn in woven and knitted fabric. Methods of measurement for tensile, tearing, ballistic and bursting tests of woven and knit fabric, Relationship among fibre, yarn and fabric strength. Measurement of fabric stiffness and its relation to crrase, handle and drape , factor effect on stiffness, handle,crease and drape of fabric.

Define and Measurement of air, water permeability/retention, water pressure, crease recovery, Serviceability, wear and abrasion tests, pilling of fabrics, Flame retardant/flame resistance tests.

Measurement of fastness to light, washing, rubbing and perspiration, Estimation of damage to materials caused by physical &amp; chemical treatments viz, singeing scouring, bleaching, Determination of size and residue of size on fabric.

Garments Testing: Garments inspection system, Seam strength, Button pull test, Zipper test and other garments tests.

Carpet Testing : Carpet thickness, Compression and durability tests.

Identification of fibres: Identification of different natural &amp; Man-Made fibres from a yarn/fabric sample, Estimation of constituent fibre percentage from blended sample.

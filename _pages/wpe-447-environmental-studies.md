Environmental challenges: Definition of environment, Soil erosion; Desertification; pest control, Biodiversity loss, deforestation; Water pollution, fisheries resources, Large dam projects; climate change, urbanization; Effluents and their effects on environment, Related health issues.

Pollution and its effects on the Living World: Definition of pollution, the atmosphere and its structure, Types of pollution and pollutants, Green house effect.

Types of Textile Pollution and their Control, Treatment:

Industrial air pollution: Emission and control technology, air quality pollution, and criteria setting.

Noise Pollution: General consideration, Industrial noise sources evaluation, methods and techniques to control and reduce noise level.

Water Pollution: Effluent in wet processing, various types of effluent

treatments. (Physical, Chemical and aerobic biochemical) and disposal systems, Use of electro-chemical technology to remove color and other contaminants from textile mill effluents.

Solid Waste management and costing: Composition of wastes, collection systems and alternatives for treatments and re-use. Reduction of textile waste water using automatic process control, recycle, filtration and waste water analysis. Determination for waste treatments costing.

Regulatory Issues: Environmental policy and law: Environmental law of Bangladesh, Role of the governmental and non-governmental organizations in the protection and conservation of environment in Bangladesh.

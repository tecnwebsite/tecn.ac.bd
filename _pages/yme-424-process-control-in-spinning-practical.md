Identification of the key variable for process control in spinning.

Establishing norms and standards for process control.

Production of Lap, Sliver, Roving and yarn, Evaluation of Lap, Sliver, roving and yarn, quality. Effect of different speed, settings of blow room and card on product quality. Effects of drawing on noil extraction of comber. Study on end breakage rate, Effect of yarn clearer setting on yarn quality, Spectogram analysis. Compare of quality of the products with USTER quality.

Prepare a plan to implement process control in spinning.

To practice Machinery audit.

Productivity analysis of different spinning machinery.

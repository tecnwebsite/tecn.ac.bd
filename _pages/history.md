<strong>British Weaving School</strong>

During the British colonial rule from 1911 to 1929, 33 peripatetic weaving schools were established in East Bengal to meet the requirements for a textile technician by offering an artisan-level six-month course. Begumgonj Textile Engineering College, Noakhali is one of them; it was established in 1918. In 1968 it was upgraded to District Weaving School offering a one-year course and in 1981 District Textile Institute offering a two-year certificate course in textile technology. But the certificate course was not acceptable to the industry.

<strong>Textile Institute, Noakhali</strong>

In 1993 a three-year diploma course was introduced under Bangladesh Technical Education Board (BTEB) which was treated as a milestone for the textile education. The duration of this course was extended to four years in 2001.

<strong>Birth of TECN</strong>

The college was upgraded in 2007 to offer a BSc in textile engineering. The course is affiliated by the Bangladesh University of Textiles.

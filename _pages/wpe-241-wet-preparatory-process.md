Introduction : Introduction of wet-chemical processing of textile materials, Impurities in fibres and greige fabrics (Cellulose, Regenerated cellulose, Protein and manmade fibres), Overview of different preparatory sequences required for their removal, preparation of different textile materials, prelims of preparation: greige testing-stamping-mending-stitching.

Water and its softening : Importance, sources, quality and different water softening treatments, Consumption and re-use of water in wet processing.

Chemicals and auxiliaries used in different preparatory wet processes General concept, classification and chemistry of detergent and surface active agents, concept of micelle, critical micelle concentration, HLB value, cloud point, specific gravity, their classification -according to chemical nature, action, mechanisms of wetting, detergency and emulsification.

Chemistry, properties and uses of acid, alkali, salts, oxidizing agents, reducing agents, and different auxiliaries used in textile wet processing.

Preparatory wet processing equipment : Working principles and functions of different machines used for yarn, woven and knit fabric preparatory wet processes in batch wise and continuous method including padder, J-box, washing machine, kiers, different mercerizing machines, equipments for water removal - contact and non-contact type of dryer, Dewatering; their construction, schematic diagram, speed, capacity etc. Preparatory wet processes : Chemistry and technology of different preparatory wet processes:

Shearing

Singeing

Desizing

Scouring (Bio-scouring)

Bleaching (Protonic treatment, Combi-bleach)

Mercerization

Enzymatic pretreatment of textiles

Pretreatment of different textile materials

Preparation of Cellulose and regenerated cellulose: Impurities present, degumming/scouring, bleaching, optical whitening of Cellulose and regenerated cellulose.

Preparation of silk and wool: Impurities present, degumming/scouring, bleaching, optical whitening of wool and silk.

Preparation of jute: Impurities present, scouring, bleaching, optical whitening Preparation of synthetic fibers and blends: Impurities present, heatsetting, singeing of manmade fibers, their blends; scouring, bleaching, optical whitening: objectives, methods, merits and demerits of different methods, wherever applicable.

Faults in different preparation process and impact of improper preparation of fabric on dyeing, printing and finishing process. Methods used for determination of degradation during scouring and bleaching. Determination of oxi-cellulose and hydrocellulose.

Effectiveness/Competitive Preparatory process: Estimation of effectiveness of scouring and bleaching process. Combined preparatory processes and energy conservation. Economics of preparatory processes.

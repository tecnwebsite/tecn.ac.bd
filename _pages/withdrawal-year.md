If a student is unable to complete the Term Final Examination due to illness, accident or any other valid reason etc., he/she may apply to the Principal through the Head of the department for total withdrawal from the Term within five working days after the end of the Term Final Examination. However, he/she may choose not to withdraw any Practical course if the grade obtained in such a course is 'D' or higher and he/she has to indicate that clearly in the withdrawal application. The withdrawal application must be supported by a medical certificate from a recognized Medical Officer. The Academic council will take the final decision about such application.

Historical development of the subject. Collection of data - Primary data and secondary data.

Frequency distribution - Grouped frequency distribution and their presentation in the form of frequency polygon, Histogram and Pie diagram.

Measures of central tendency:
<ul>
 	<li>Mean : (a) Arithmetic Mean (b) Geometric Mean, (c) Harmonic</li>
</ul>
Mean
<ul>
 	<li>Median</li>
 	<li>Their definition, computation, Advantage, Disadvantage and uses.</li>
</ul>
Measures of dispersion:
<ul>
 	<li>Absolute measure. (a) Range (b) Mean deviation (c) Quartile deviation (d) standard deviation.</li>
 	<li>Relative measure. (a) coefficient of variation. Their definition, computation and uses.</li>
</ul>
Moment, skew ness and kurtosis - Their definition, computation and uses.

Probability - Simple idea of probability. Different definitions related to probability. Addition law of 'probability for mutually exclusive and notmutually exclusive events. Multiplication law of probabilities for dependent and independent events. Probability distribution (i) Binomial, (ii) Poission, (iii) Simple idea about normal distribution and its probability curve.

Estimation - Simple idea about estimation : Estimation of population mean and proportions, sample size and related mathematical problem.

Correlation and Regression :
<ul>
 	<li>Correlation - Ideas of correlation. Measurement of -correlation.</li>
</ul>
Pearsonian correlation co-efficient. and spearman's Rank correlation co-efficient.
<ul>
 	<li>Multiple correlation</li>
 	<li>Regression - Ideas about simple regression. Equation of the regression line. Estimation of the parameters of the regression line.</li>
 	<li>Multiple regression.</li>
</ul>
Test of significance - some definitions related to test of significance
<ul>
 	<li>t - test. (a) Comparison of a sample mean with a known population mean when S.D. is known and when S.D. is not known. (b) Comparison of two sample means when S.D. is known and also when it is unknown. (c) Paired t test, its practical use in Textile Industry.</li>
 	<li>X2 test - Simple application and its practical use in Industry. (iii) Test related to proportions.</li>
</ul>
Sampling - Definition of population, sample, parameter, census etc.

(i) Simple Random Sampling, (ii) Stratified random sampling. (iii) Cluster sampling (iv) Systematic sampling, Their definition, computation, use, advantage, disadvantage and related mathematical problems.

Design of experiment : Basic principles of experimental design. Ideas about CRD, RBI) and related mathematical problems.

Time series analysis : General idea about time series, different types of time series there construction and computation.

Index Number : General idea about index number, different types of index number, different tests related to index number and its mathematical interpretation.

Demand Analysis : General idea about demand analysis, mathematical interpretation and problems.

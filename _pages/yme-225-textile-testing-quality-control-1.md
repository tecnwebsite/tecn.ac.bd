Introduction to Textile Testing and quality control, Importance of Textile Testing. Sampling methods.

Moisture: Moisture content and moisture regain, standard moisture regain of different fibres. Effects of moisture on textiles. Relative humidity, measurement of relative humidity, standard conditions for testing, importance of moisture regain, methods of measurement of moisture in textiles.

<strong>Fibre Testing:</strong>

Fibre length: Length, staple length, effective length, span length, fibre length dispersion, short fibre percentage, methods of fibre length measurement.

Fineness &amp; maturity of cotton: Definition, importance, relationship between fineness &amp; maturity, methods of measurement and expressions of results, maturity ratio.

Neps: Definition, causes of nep formation, measurement of neps.

Trash and Foreign matters: Measurement of trash and foreign matters in fibre. Tensile strength: Single fibre &amp; fibre bundle test, comparison between single fibre &amp; bundle test.

Modern Fibre Testing Equipments: Scope of AFIS &amp; HVI for fibre testing. Calibration system and basic working principle of AFIS &amp; HVI Yarn Testing:

Measurement of linear density of lap, sliver, roving &amp; yarn. Different methods of numbering yarn. Interrelationship among different yarn numbering systems.

Twist in yarn: Definition of twist, different types of twist, measurement of twist. Effect of twist on yarn properties.

<strong>Yarn Testing:</strong>

Sample and different Sampling methods, Measurement of tensile strength of yarn; single thread, skein or lea strength and ballistic test; comparison of results, CRT, CRE, and CRL machines and methods of loading.

Sliver, roving and yarn irregularity; measurement by cutting and weighing methods, thickness under compression, capacitance and other methods; length variance curves. Use of spectrogram for analysis of periodic, random and drafting wave variation, Measurement of imperfections. Comparison of results with Uster statistics. Procedure for correction and implementation of result.

Classification of yarn faults, working principle of Classimate tester, yarn clearer, typical quality requirement of knit and woven yarn for export textile manufacturing.

Measurement of yarn hairiness

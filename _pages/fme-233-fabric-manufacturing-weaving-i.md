Introduction and historical background of fabric manufacturing. Flow chart for weaving.

Weaving Preparation :

Introduction to yarn preparation.

Winding : Types of winding package, precision and non precision winding, Yarn tensioning devices, cop, cheese, pirn and cone winding machines, winding defects and their remedies.

Warping : Direct and Sectional warping, Warping machines, Warping plan for a particular fabric, Faults in Warping and their remedies.

Sizing : Size materials and their function, Technological changes due to sizing, Typical recipes, Mechanism of size take-up, Methods and factors of drying, Dressing of jute yarn, Warp sizing and weaving efficiency, Sizing of blended and synthetic yarn, Defects in sizing and their remedies.

Weaving :

Looming : Drafing, drawing, denting, pinning, tying-in and gaiting, Machineries involved in these processes.

Introduction to the historical/ development of looms, Classification of looms and description of various types of conventional looms. Motions of looms.

Sheds and Shedding : Various types of shed. Objective and classification of shedding, Tappet shedding:- timing and dwell period. Dobby sheddingmechanisms, Peg plan. Types and basic principles of Jacquard shedding mechanisms.

Picking : Classification, over and under picking mechanisms. Controlling factors of picking, picking faults.

Beating : Classification, principles of crank and crank arm, duble beat-up mechanisms, Sley eccentricity ratio and its effects.

Take-up &amp; Let-off Mechanisms : Classification, pick spacing and its controlling factors, calculations of take-up constant, picks/ cm and rate of let-off. Automatic Conventional Weaving : Features of automatic looms, weft replenishments, methods of warp and weft patterning, warp protector motion, causes of warp and weft breakage in weaving, warp stop motions, side and centre weft fork mechanism.

Jacquard weaving : Different Jacquard looms. Systems of harness mounting, methods of increasing the figuring capacity.

Modern weaving : Features of modern looms, brief study of projectile, Rapier, Air jet, Water jet and Multiphase weaving machines with modern shedding and beat-up systems.

Loom efficiency with controlling factors, Layout of a particular weaving floor, Utilities required for weaving.

Fabric faults-their causes and remedies, Standard commercial fabrics (jute/ cotton/ synthetic).

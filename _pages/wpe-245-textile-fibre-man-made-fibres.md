Definition and classification of Chemical fibres, Principles of different spinning systems, Different fibre structures and their effects on fibre properties, Global trends and consumption of man-made fibres.

Composition, structure, classification, manufacturing process, properties uses and application of :
<ol>
 	<li>Regenerated fibres : Viscose, Acetate rayon, derivatives of cellulose and regenerated protein fibres.</li>
 	<li>Synthetic fibres : Polyolifin, Polyester, Polyamide, Polyacrylic, Polyvinyl derivaties Polyurethane etc.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li>High Performance fibres : Aramid, Carbon, Glass, Polyethylene darivaties, Ceramic and other commonly used high performance fibres. iv) High functional fibres: Bi / Multicomponent fibres etc.</li>
</ul>
Latest development in man-made fibre production and their economical and social aspects.

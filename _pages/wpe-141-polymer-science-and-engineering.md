Introduction and historical development of polymer chemistry.

Basic concept of polymer science (Terms, definitions and scope)

Classification of polymers and their description (Linear, branched, crosslinked, homo-polymers, co-polymers etc.), Raw materials (sources and their derivatives).

Synthesis of Polymers (Mechanism of polymerization, Methods of polymerization)

Types of molecular weights (number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight), distribution and measurements of molecular weights and study of molecular weight dependent properties (end-groups, viscosity etc.).

Chemical and geometrical structure of polymer molecule (crystallization and melting of polymers, amorphous state-rheology, glass transition temperature, crosslinking, stereochemistry, transition, entropy elasticity etc.).

Evaluation, characterization and analysis of polymers (chemical, spectroscopic, scattering, thermal, surface analyses etc.)

Properties of polymers (mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, degradability etc.).

Study of commonly used fiber forming polymeric materials (Nylon, PET etc.) Depolymerization, Polymer recycling.
